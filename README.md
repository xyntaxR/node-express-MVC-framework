	<h1>Framework using JavaScript, NodeJS, and Express</h1>
	<p>This is a framework built using JavaScript, NodeJS, and Express that other developers can use as a starting point for their own projects. The framework provides a solid foundation for building web applications and offers the option to integrate with both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.</p>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>To install the framework, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then you can clone this repository and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:</p>
	<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	<p>The framework comes pre-configured to work with both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. You can choose which database to use by choosing the BaseModel in system folder.</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>To start the framework, run the following command:</p>
	<pre><code>npm run dev</code></pre>
	<p>This will start the server and make it available at <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a>. You can then use this as a starting point for your own web application by modifying the existing code or adding your own routes and middleware. Make sure you have installed nodemon.</p>
